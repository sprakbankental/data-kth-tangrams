# Srpåkbanken Tal static copy

This repo is a static duplicate of another repository that has been given to 
Språkbanken Tal (http://sprakbanken.speech.kth.se/), a Swedsih national research
infrastructure for speech-centric science, so that Språkbanken Tal can maintain a 
peristant copy, for example to keep materials related to a publication available.

The repository was copied from REPO on DATE. The licensing was decided in agreement
with the author of the material, AUTHOR.

**Note that this repository in itself is not necessarily persistant. The persistant link to
